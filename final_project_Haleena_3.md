# What I changed for the FInal Presentation 


There have been many changes that I have reflected on from [Part 2](https://haleena426.github.io/Phillips-Haleena-Portfolio/final_project_Haleena_2.html) that I was able to incorporate into my final project. The first was surrounding my intended audience and the way I told the story. This then informed my visualizations and how I structured them in my shorthand presentation. I noted in part 2 that I wanted to describe my story in layman's terms as I previously used complex verbage to describe the issue. I wrote exactly how I would change that in part 2 and is noted below. 
*The U.S reliance on international drug manufacturers leaves the older American population, who rely on these drugs, vulnerable. This is because drug shortages disproportionately  affect those ages 45+ and puts your (my intended audience) loved ones at risk. The top 5 drug classes that are in shortage can cause adverse health effects and drive up unnecessary health related costs. Based upon America’s actions, that are out of our control, it is necessary for us (intended audience) to help our elders know their options when it comes to mitigating this issue. The majority (87%) of healthcare providers utilize therapeutic alternatives as an alternative to the drug shortage. Our elders should be encouraged to talk to their healthcare providers about their options but it is imperative to educate them. 
** My intended audience are people with parents who are 45+. I did this in response to an interview question I received from my classmates on why this matters. Many people who are not interested in healthcare may not be drawn to the topic so I thought if I am directly speaking to my classmates they may listen. Every single student, or almost everyone, in class has someone in their life that is 45+ that they care about. I intended to utilize this to my advantage. 

Based upon their feedback, I was able to really hone in my story. There were some aspects that were not clear such as the call to action when I received feedback from my issues. I was able to  make sure that I clearly described the goal of the call to action by utilizing links and writing summaries to further expand. It is to educate our elders and encourage them to talk about their options with their healthcare provider when it comes to mitigating drug shortages. I think during my mock presentations, I relied too much on the graphic to tell the story without the added background. This was changed in my shorthand visualization. Based upon the question that came up surrounding if the sketches were my final graphics, I made sure to do a digital version of the graphics to make sure they are cleaner. Additionally, I wrote out any abbreviations on my graphics to make sure they are clear and I provided summaries, based upon my feedback. The question was what are the full names and as someone who has a scientific background, I sometimes forget that these abbreviations may not be common knowledge to everyone even if they are to me. 

The design decisions I made were contingent on taking complex data sets and turning them into easily understandable and digestible visualizations. I took into consideration colorblind colors, the simplicity of bar, line, and pie charts, and thought of ways that my shorthand could catch people’s attention. For example, my title was engaging in the way that it was animated, I had facts laid out with backgrounds that matched the information being presented, My visualizations were interactive, and I was intentional with color schemes. With animations, I hoped that my audience would be engaged and the motion of certain images would draw their attention there. I used this same logic for some of my graphs to show outward to inward focus and used moving descriptions to ensure that people read them. Overall, shorthand was a valuable method to emphasize and effectively communicate my data

# How I came to my Final Project

This section is provided to incorporate some aspects from part 1 and 2 in order for the audience to follow exactly how I came to my final project. 

My topic for this project surrounds drug shortages in the United States and I was able to create a good understanding of how I wanted to shape it throught the example provided in class. 

**Synopsis of Topic**

For this part of the outline, I chose to come up with an engaging title that would want the audience to learn more about my topic. Though I wasn't able to solidify a title so early in the process, I settled upon these two titles. **The United States reliance on international drug manufacturers only hurts itself ** and **The United States shooting itself in the foot by leaning too heavily on international drugmakers for its medicine fix.**

The next section addressed the audience and what the would expect when they were to take in the graphics that I have to display. I have chosen my intended audience to be everyday citizens who are impacted by the lack of prescription drugs due to America’s reliance on international manufacturers. 

**As a reader, I want ____ so that I can_____**

I intend the audience to grasp this below.

As a reader, I want to explore the different perspectives and implications on manufacturer reliance so that I can make my own well informed opinion. 

This section is self explanatory as it comes right after the wants. The way the audience member is able to act based upon their wants can be shown below.. 

**I can do this by_____**

I can do this by maintaining open communication with my healthcare provider so that I can stay informed and be prepared for any shortages. 

I then thought of how I could inciorporate graphics into this presentation and through research, I was able in to hone in repetitive information that many sources spewed leading me to beleive that it was important or necessary to note when speaking on drug shortages. The specific graphics can be found in [Final Project Part 2](https://haleena426.github.io/Phillips-Haleena-Portfolio/final_project_Haleena_2.html)

In Part 2, I continued to refine my story through interveiws. I wanted to make sure what I wanted to communicate was effectively being told. I did two rounds of presentations. The first round involved individuals from the Telling Stories with Data Course and this was helpful in the way we were around the same skill set level and were able to provide me with feedback people outside of the class may not have been able to. This included color scheme, visualization type, and most importantly audience. After this round of interviews, I decided to change my scope from people who took drugs to people with an emotional investment with people whose quality of life will decrease becuase they dont get their necessary drugs. This would ensure the engagement that I am looking for. For my second round of interviews, I interveiwed people who were not in school to ensure that my audeince outside of the classroom would also be able to interpret and get something out of my presentation. With their feedback, I was able to note that my call to action was not as clear. Initially it was just providing the facts and data but from my interviews I consistenly received feedback on what specifically did I want my audeience to do for the next steps. This made me be explicit in my final presrentation. The links for my final shorthand pressentation can be found at the start of the page.
