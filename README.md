# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for my Telling Stories with Data class at CMU

# About Me
Hi, my name is Haleena Phillips and I am a second year Master of Public Policy and Management student with a Health Policy Concentration at Carnegie Mellon University. My pronouns are she/her and I love chocolate chip cookies

# What I Hope to Learn
At the completion of this course, I hope to learn how to effectively tell stories with the data I display as opposed to showing data that I have obtained. Once I graduate, I hope to move back to Washington, DC and do federal work.
