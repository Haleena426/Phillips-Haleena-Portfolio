# Critique By Design With Tableau

For this assignment, I was tasked with finding an existing data visualization and critiquing it. The visualization I chose is shown below and it describes the cost effectiveness of various products per 30G of serving of protein.

Though I believed this graphic needed some work, I thought it did a great job of telling a story to its intended audience. As someone who goes to the gym and pays attention to how much protein I intake, I also would like to know how many calories are in the food I digest. It is important for me to obtain low calorie but high protein diet.
