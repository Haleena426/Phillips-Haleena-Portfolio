# Critique By Design With Tableau

For this assignment, I was tasked with finding an existing data visualization and critiquing it. The visualization I chose is shown below and it describes the cost effectiveness of various products per 30G of serving of protein.

I chose this visualization becuase the images captured my attention. As a focal pooint of the visuaalization, I found it very unsatisfactory to have such small icons with text that was even smaller. I notices a lot more probles with this chart and thought that it would give me the ability to provide a lengthy analysis. When initially looking at this graph, I implied that it is trying to give people who go to the gym information on what protein sources are the most cost effective while also providing information on how many calories these items may have.Through my analysis below, that implication stayed true but I changed the way I way I would display this information.

What really stood out to me were the photos/icons and the titles. Those were the things I looked at first. The title was big and bold and I believe that was intentionally done to draw attention to it. The font was simple so I think it evoked more maturity since the information is more serious and scientific. I think these elements worked well together. Also, looking at the photos, I liked the idea of having the photos but ultimately, for images such as quorn, I don't think it did a great job because I personally have no idea what that is and the font on the photo was very small. None of this aided my further understanding. I would get rid of these photos altogether. I also think the subtitle/ description worked really well in pinpointing exactly what the author was trying to tell but I don't think it did enough. As stated before, the unit needs to be represented and it could have been done there for more understanding or even in the axis. Also, there isn't any information on the caloric value but the calories are posted. I would have liked to see more information on this. In accordance with the layout, I like the simplicity of it. I would keep the bar graph but switch the axis. This would then shift the graph sideways. This will be shown in my rendition of the graph. 

I do believe all of the factors below that we have described are imperative in analyzing a data visualization. 

In looking at the **usefulness** of the visualization, I kept in mind the intended audience of the graphic in which I thought the authors were very effective at communicating. As someone who goes to the gym and pays attention to how much protein I intake, I also would like to know how many calories are in the food I digest. It is important for me to obtain a low calorie but high protein diet. My thoughts were confirmed when I noted the ‘Body Building Dieticians’ icon towards the bottom. This gives insight that this graphic is meant for individuals who are trying to utilize protein for muscular gain. I think without this icon, it would not have been as effective because it leaves a wider audience to critique. By emphasizing that in the title, tied with the icon, I think the author does a good job to evoke that. I do not think they did a great job at going into depth on the cost effectiveness of the item. This should have been more specific and I would change that. 

To produce a level of understanding, I think the graphic does a good job in its **completeness**. I originally argued that it may not be necessary to insert the amount of calories but thought against it when I realized that with body builders, you would like a high protein amount with low caloric value. This is intuitive and again works for the intended audience. It would be an understandable critique to think so but it is imperative to keep in mind the audience. To be more clear, any information surrounding calories should be included in the title or description. 

In analyzing the **perceptibility**, I thought the graph was okay. Personally, I did not think the pictures of the foods were necessary and made it a bit cluttered throwing off the **aesthetics**. It is easy to look at the graph and receive the story but the uniformity of the photos required more than minimal effort to figure out what was going on. I don't think they were necessary.  

I also thought the **truthfulness** of the graphic was okay since the cost was missing and I was not sure what the measure was based on. Was it the average cost of those items in a particular store or the nationwide average? If someone were to walk in a store and not see the price depicted, it would not be truthful. However, the overall story the graphic was trying to tell was pretty **intuitive**. From all of the elements, I was pretty sure what the author was trying to evoke except the cost and whether it was for a unit item. I had to make assumptions so that is my only dismay. 

The **engagement** was also well done in the way that it made me reconsider my protein intake options to get the most cost effective protein for my goals. Though every single protein option wasn't stated, it made me want to go look up more information for my specific supermarkets. I think this will be true for the intended audience. For more engagement the prices should have been listed as the average cost for a local grocery store to connect more with the audience. 

Ultimately, My first recommendation of this chart would be to keep the type of visualization but add the average costs of each item for either a local store or nationwide average costs. The second recommendation would be to add color to tell a story. My best friend is a vegetarian so I have become more aware of the foods I digest when I am with her and just looking at this chart, I would not know if the protein is plant based or meat based without further research. I would have one color designated to plant protein and another designated to meat protein. 

# My Sketch Makeover

After my analysis, I tried to draw a quick sketch of how I qould reimagine this graphic. It is shown below.

I then recieved feedback from two women around the ages of 23-25. Both of these women attend Carnegie Mellon University with one being an Arts Management student and the other a Robotics student. I think this is imperitive to note as thier lived experinces and backgrounds may impact the way they think. I'd also like to note that the Arts Management student is not a vegetarian while the Robotics student is. The Robotics student also is frequently active while the Arts Management student is not. Their feedback is noted below to the following questions. The first repsonses are represented by the Arts Management woman and the second is the Robotics student

* Can you tell me what you think this is?
  1. I think this is a chart showing protein prices per 30 g split into categories of plant based v meat based.
  2. Bar chart of “Protein Cost analysis” with price of a specific protein per 30 grams of protein (ie x axis is unit cost $$$ per 30 grams)

* Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
  1. This is telling me that overall, plant based protein options are cheaper than meat based.
  2. The price of specific plant bass and meat based proteins per 30 grams
     
* Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
  1. What is Quorn? I also did this article and i think it would be helpful to use the proteins described in the article AND the chart since they are different.
  2. Not especially. Quorn is fake meat so it makes sense that it is more expensive 

* Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
  1. Anyone who is interested in fitness or healthy eating.
  2. Perhaps consumers of protein

* Is there anything you would change or do differently?
  1. Maybe use a different color palette because red/pink and green is not accessible for colorblindness
  2. Maybe say this x is unit cost per 30 grams lol because that confused me i guess

# Incorporating Feedback

This feedback was extemely helpful in providing my final draft of my visualization. Thank you to those who participated. It can be seen below.

I was able to change the colors to be more colorblind friendly, turn the graph by changing the axes, and providing a more in depth description. I removed any confusing acronyms from the previous graphic such as WPI and took advice from my critquer to get more information from the article. The numbers should not be taken at face value.
