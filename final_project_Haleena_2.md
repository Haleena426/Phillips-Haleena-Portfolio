# Draft WireFrames 

I initially wanted to create my first draft in Storyboard but it was taking too much time as it is my first time using it and I did not like how it was coming out. I instead utilized the hand drawn sketches from my first part. My story unfolds below.

I cut out many visualizations from part one and tried to get a gist of the overall story I was trying to tell in one minute. This still did not cut it and the next section will give more insight on the interviews and how I was able to redefine my story. 

# User Research and Interviews

I utilized class time to work out my initial interviews to really draw in my scope better. I showed my initial draft of my data to my classmates and this acted as my first rounds of feedback that I would then take to finalize my draft. The participants were 3 individuals - 2 women and 1 man who were all Masters students at Carnegie Mellon University: Heinz College. They were all within the same age range from 23-27 and were all completing the Telling Stories with Data class which is important to note for any biases and specific observations that were made. The questions were adapted from the test and get feedback worksheet and are as follows. 

* What worked?
	* What was exciting?
	* What did you value the most?
	* What resonated about the idea?
* What didnâ€™t work?
	* What would you change?
	* What suggestions do you have for improvement?
	* What would make it better?
* What questions came up?
	* What needs further investigation?
	* What made you curious
* What new inspiration arose?
	* What surprised you?

The way these interviews were conducted played into sporadic responses were. Instead of one on one interviews, the results from my primary interviews were a summary as everyone spoke together. They are as follows:

| What Worked | What Didnt work | What Questions Came Up | What New Inspiration Arose |
|------|------------------|------|------------------|
|The set up really worked. The interviewees were really interested in the topic and thought it was a good one  | The lure. The interviewees were not lured into the presentation but focused on it based on the small group we had.  |  Based upon your audience, why as a class should we care and engage with your presentation? | What surprised the interviewees were the existence of drug shortages. Because of this, the call to action was inspiring. |
|      |                  | Who is Your Audience?    |                  |


I then conducted secondary interviews of a secondary draft that actually told a story instead of just showcasing data 


| What Worked | What Didnt work | What Questions Came Up | What New Inspiration Arose |
|------|------------------|------|------------------|
|      |                  |      |                  |
|      |                  |      |                  |
|      |                  |      |                  |
