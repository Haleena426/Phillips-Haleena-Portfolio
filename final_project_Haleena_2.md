# Draft WireFrames 

I initially wanted to create my first draft in Storyboard but it was taking too much time as it is my first time using it and I did not like how it was coming out. I instead utilized hand drawn sketches. My story unfolds below. 

# User Research and Interviews

I utilized class time to work out my initial interviews to really draw in my scope better. I showed my initial draft of my data to my classmates and this acted as my first rounds of feedback that I would then take to finalize my draft. The participants were 3 individuals - 2 women and 1 man who were all Masters students at Carnegie Mellon University: Heinz College. They were all within the same age range from 23-27 and were all completing the Telling Stories with Data class which is important to note for any biases and specific observations that were made. 


I then conducted secondary interviews of a secondary draft that actually told a story instead of just showcasing data
