# Draft WireFrames 

I initially wanted to create my first draft in Storyboard but it was taking too much time as it is my first time using it and I did not like how it was coming out. I instead utilized the hand drawn sketches from my first part. My story unfolds below.

I cut out many visualizations from part one and tried to get a gist of the overall story I was trying to tell in one minute. This still did not cut it and the next section will give more insight on the interviews and how I was able to redefine my story. 

# User Research and Interviews

I utilized class time to work out my initial interviews to really draw in my scope better. I showed my initial draft of my data to my classmates and this acted as my first rounds of feedback that I would then take to finalize my draft. The participants were 3 individuals - 2 women and 1 man who were all Masters students at Carnegie Mellon University: Heinz College. They were all within the same age range from 23-27 and were all completing the Telling Stories with Data class which is important to note for any biases and specific observations that were made. The questions were adapted from the test and get feedback worksheet and are as follows. 

* What worked?
	* What was exciting?
	* What did you value the most?
	* What resonated about the idea?
* What didn’t work?
	* What would you change?
	* What suggestions do you have for improvement?
	* What would make it better?
* What questions came up?
	* What needs further investigation?
	* What made you curious
* What new inspiration arose?
	* What surprised you?

The way these interviews were conducted played into sporadic responses were. Instead of one on one interviews, the results from my primary interviews were a summary as everyone spoke together. They are as follows:

| What Worked | What Didnt work | What Questions Came Up | What New Inspiration Arose |
|------|------------------|------|------------------|
|The set up really worked. The interviewees were really interested in the topic and thought it was a good one  | The lure. The interviewees were not lured into the presentation but focused on it based on the small group we had.  |  Based upon your audience, why as a class should we care and engage with your presentation? | What surprised the interviewees were the existence of drug shortages. Because of this, the call to action was inspiring. |
|      |                  | Who is Your Audience?    |                  |


Based upon this feedback, I changed many things for another draft that slightly mirrors what I plan to do in shorthand through sketches. I decided to initially focus my scope around the older generations and frame my presentation in a way that appeals to the intended audience's emotions. Based upon this initial feedback I was able to then answer these questions with a new scope in mind. 

* The target audience you hope to reach with your story
	* My intended audience will be demographics who have parents and/ or grandparents who are 45+.
* My approach to identifying representative individuals to interview
	* My approach to identifying individuals will be people who fall within my intended audience. They do not need to have any other specific background but it would be beneficial to find participants who care for their elders as I am relying on emotions to draw in my audience. To vet them, I would ask if their parents fall within the age range that I am trying to focus on. 
* My new interview script
	* This script would mirror my previous interview questions

Below is my updated visualization where I only utilized 3 out of the 4 original visualizations that I had to keep it concise and around a minute. I will note what I changed on an individual level underneath each visual and note each part of the story. Instead of using Shorthand for my initial draft, I used screenshot from a powerpoint with my ideas. This will mimic what I hope to incorporate into Shorthand. I didnt receive any feedback on the collor scheme or design choices, but mostly on the storyline.

From the feedback that I received, I focused on what didn’t work initially. The lure did not work per my feedback so I decided to change the focus of the story. The intended audience will be the demographics of parents and/ or grandparents who are 25+ so I hope to draw in most of the class’ attention with that change. This was done by changing the title from ‘The United States Reliance on International Drug Manufacturers Only Hurts Itself’ which was broad to ‘Generational Rx: How America’s Global Drug Reliance Harms Our Elders.’ In doing this, the topic is more pointed and gives insight to who my intended audience is. The image is copyrighted so I will have to change it but this is the gist.

As we continue the hypothetical scroll down shorthand, the next slide consists of a reimagined visualization. A question that an interviewee asked that I didnt note was "how do you think you are going to fit all of this into a minute." I left this out because I didnt beleive that it fell into any of the categories as my intended goal with my first visualizations was to telll a story and not necessarily keep it under a minute. WIth my changed scope in mind, I realized that my inital pie chart visualization titled 'Reasons for Drug Shortages,' that can be found above, was not something that was imperative for the audience to see but was worth mentioning. Therefore, I beleived a line would suffice. This part of the story says exactly what I am trying to say; 80% of the active ingredients found in U.S drugs are made internationally and because of that, when there are problems with the manufacturing sites, it is out of the U.S' control and leads to drug shortages.

The next slide in the shorthand will be this graph initially being shown the biger picture with all of the data (left) transitioning to the data of focus on the right with the specific age groups 45+. I decided to do this based upon the feedback "why do I care about this." I thought this was an extremely valid response and decided to input information from < 45 years of age. This will put things into perspective for my audience as the biggest range of ages still does not measure to > 45. This part of the story states exactly that but I plan to emphasize that my intended audience's elders are disproportionaltely affected by drug shortages. Hopefully this will solve the problem of the lure by appealing to my audience's emotions while showing why they should care about this topic.

This part of the story introduces the top 5 drug classes with shortages. What I hope to communicate

**Story Summary**

Based upon my previous analysis, I wanted to describe my story in laymans terms and provide a snippet of what I hope to communicate to my audience for my presentation. The U.S reliance on international drug manufacturers leaves the older American population, who rely on these drugs, vulnerable. This is because drug shortages disproportionately  affect those ages 45+ and puts your (my intended audience) loved ones at risk. The top 5 drug classes that are in shortage can cause adverse health effects and drive up unnecessary health related costs. Based upon America’s actions, that are out of our control, it is necessary for us (intended audience) to help our elders know their options when it comes to mitigating this issue. The majority (87%) of healthcare providers utilize therapeutic alternatives as an alternative to the drug shortage. Our elders should be encouraged to talk to their healthcare providers about their options but it is imperative to educate them. 

**Interview Responses**

I was able to interview 3 men between the ages of 25-30. They all have parents and grandparents that are 45+ and two out of three of them were not in school. I purposefully did that in order to see if there was a difference between what my classmates who are currently enrolled in the Telling Stories with Data class versus nonacademics/ people who were not enrolled. This ensured that my intended audeince would be able to understand my soty in and out of the classroom. 


| What Worked | What Didnt work | What Questions Came Up | What New Inspiration Arose |
|------|------------------|------|------------------|
|    Problem statement and conflict very clear  | unclear on the options for call to action, make sure this is emphasized | What are the full names of the drugs on the bar chart?  |                  |
| Visuals were nice | the lure was not explicit | the call to action is not clear, what happens after I inform my elders |                  |
| Visuals made sense and were straight to the point | Everything was fine |      |                  |


* Changes I plan on implementing to your visualizations next week to address the issues identified. 
	* Based upon their feedback, I plan to really hone in my story in time for my minute presentation next week. There were some aspects that were not clear such as the call to action. I will make sure that I am clearly describing that the goal of the call to action is to educate our elders and encourage them to talk about their options with their healthcare provider when it comes to mitigating drug shortages. I think during my mock presentations, I relied too much on the graphic to tell the story without the added background.
