# Draft WireFrames 

I initially wanted to create my first draft in Storyboard but it was taking too much time as it is my first time using it and I did not like how it was coming out. I instead utilized the hand drawn sketches from my first part. My story unfolds below.

I cut out many visualizations from part one and tried to get a gist of the overall story I was trying to tell in one minute. This still did not cut it and the next section will give more insight on the interviews and how I was able to redefine my story. 

# User Research and Interviews

I utilized class time to work out my initial interviews to really draw in my scope better. I showed my initial draft of my data to my classmates and this acted as my first rounds of feedback that I would then take to finalize my draft. The participants were 3 individuals - 2 women and 1 man who were all Masters students at Carnegie Mellon University: Heinz College. They were all within the same age range from 23-27 and were all completing the Telling Stories with Data class which is important to note for any biases and specific observations that were made. The questions were adapted from the test and get feedback worksheet and are as follows. 

* What worked?
	* What was exciting?
	* What did you value the most?
	* What resonated about the idea?
* What didn’t work?
	* What would you change?
	* What suggestions do you have for improvement?
	* What would make it better?
* What questions came up?
	* What needs further investigation?
	* What made you curious
* What new inspiration arose?
	* What surprised you?

The way these interviews were conducted played into sporadic responses were. Instead of one on one interviews, the results from my primary interviews were a summary as everyone spoke together. They are as follows:

| What Worked | What Didnt work | What Questions Came Up | What New Inspiration Arose |
|------|------------------|------|------------------|
|The set up really worked. The interviewees were really interested in the topic and thought it was a good one  | The lure. The interviewees were not lured into the presentation but focused on it based on the small group we had.  |  Based upon your audience, why as a class should we care and engage with your presentation? | What surprised the interviewees were the existence of drug shortages. Because of this, the call to action was inspiring. |
|      |                  | Who is Your Audience?    |                  |


Based upon this feedback, I changed many things for another draft that slightly mirrors what I plan to do in shorthand through sketches. I decided to initially focus my scope around the older generations and frame my presentation in a way that appeals to the intended audience's emotions. Based upon this initial feedback I was able to then answer these questions with a new scope in mind. 

* The target audience you hope to reach with your story
	* My intended audience will be demographics who have parents and/ or grandparents who are 45+.
* My approach to identifying representative individuals to interview
	* My approach to identifying individuals will be people who fall within my intended audience. They do not need to have any other specific background but it would be beneficial to find participants who care for their elders as I am relying on emotions to draw in my audience. To vet them, I would ask if their parents fall within the age range that I am trying to focus on. 
* My new interview script
	* This script would mirror my previous interview questions

Below is my updated visualization where I only utilized 3 out of the 4 original visualizations that I had to keep it concise and around a minute. I will note what I changed on an individual level underneath each visual and note each part of the story. Instead of using Shorthand for my initial draft, I used screenshot from a powerpoint with my ideas. This will mimic what I hope to incorporate into Shorthand.

From the feedback that I received, I focused on what didn’t work initially. The lure did not work per my feedback so I decided to change the focus of the story. The intended audience will be the demographics of parents and/ or grandparents who are 25+ so I hope to draw in most of the class’ attention with that change. This was done by changing the title from ‘The United States Reliance on International Drug Manufacturers Only Hurts Itself’ which was broad to ‘Generational Rx: How America’s Global Drug Reliance Harms Our Elders.’ In doing this, the topic is more pointed and gives insight to who my intended audience is.
