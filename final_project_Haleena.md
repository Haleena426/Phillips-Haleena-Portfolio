# Outline

My topic for this project surrounds drug shortages in the United States. Before going into the specific details of the proposal, I thought the exercise we did in class was extremely helpful in making my project more concise and I shared that below to provide a background on the origins of the outline. 

**Synopsis of Topic**

The next section addressed the audience and what the would expect when they were to take in the graphics that I have to display. I have chosen my intended audience to be everyday citizens who are impacted by the lack of prescription drugs due to America’s reliance on intnrational manufacturers. 

**As a reader, I want ____ so that I can_____**

I intend the audience to grasp this below.

As a reader, I want to explore the different perspectives and implications on manufacturer reliance so that I can make my own well informed opinion. 

This section is self explanatory as it comes right after the wants. The way the audience member is able to act based upon their wants can be shown below.. 

**I can do this by_____**

I can do this by maintaining open communication with my healthcare provider so that I can stay informed and be prepared for any shortages. 

**How do I tell the story?**

I decided to initially showcase this example by providing the info, conflict, and call to action. In class, there was a resolution aspect but I decided to tie that in with the call to action. The Y axis represents three smiley faces in which they represent: (bottom) sad, medium (alright), top (happy). The way I intertwined my story can be shown below.

**High Level Outline**

Now that the outline has been shown above and the reader is able to follow along with my thought process, it is necessary to provide a higher level outline and background so that the author is well informed. Overall, the story I am trying to tell is that the U.S reliance on international manufacturing negatively affects consumers but they can work with their healthcare providers to prepare for any drug shortages. 

After a discussion with Dr. Goranson, we thought it may be best to incorporate my sketches as I am telling the story. 

The United States has a reputation for having one of the best healthcare systems in regards to the resources and technology that we have. There are debates that critique our delivery system but that will not be the focus of this outline. With that reputation, many Americans are under the impression that they will be able to receive the care, attention, and medication that they need in order to have a high quality life. This does not take into account costs associated with these plans or socioeconomic background. Just at face value, there is an expectation that in America, the treatment is available for any abnormality that deviates from what an individual describes as healthy. 

To cut costs, the United States strategically uses manufacturers internationally but there are problems that arise that are out of the U.S’ control. I will be using the first sketch below to display this fact.

** I chose this sketch to outline the first part of my story, to emphasize that the reliance on international manufacturers will be the U.S drug system’s demise. By showing a visual, the audience is able to initially have a deeper understanding of what specifically causes these shortages without going into the nitty gritty details. This graphic specifically emphasizes manufacturers as a whole which equates to 1 in a sense. By using a pie chart, I am able to exemplify this information in simple terms and break down the parts of that whole. Though I state the reliance on outside manufacturers are the demise, the pie chart them emphasizes the even smaller parts that represent the manufacturer that the U.S has no control over. Delving deeper into the sketch, I chose those colors because they were colorblind friendly and would appeal to multiple audiences. The specific colors within the coloblind friendly realm did not have any thought process. They were random.

# Data 

All of my data is derived from data sources linked below. https://www.iqvia.com/insights/the-iqvia-institute/reports-and-publications/reports/drug-shortages-in-the-us-2023, https://aspe.hhs.gov/reports/drug-shortages-impacts-consumer-costs#:~:text=The%20average%20drug%20shortage%20affects,ability%20to%20fill%20their%20prescriptions., 
https://www.ashp.org/-/media/assets/drug-shortages/docs/ASHP-2023-Drug-Shortages-Survey-Report.pdf, 
https://www.ashp.org/drug-shortages/shortage-resources/drug-shortages-statistics?loginreturnUrl=SSOCheckOnly

The way this data will be used is described through my sketches. The methodology of how the information was derived and why it was used can be found under the sketch. Overall, I chose these specific data sources because they use empirical and scientific data. These links include information that rely on surveys and studies for completion. By using this information, I am able to get the voice of those affected while having some scientific evidence to back it up. In my opinion I thought this was very valuable. 

The links are from two main websites IQVIA which is a data source/ database that provides clinical data from their own research and is world renowned. For this data source, I will be using the scientific data that has clinicians report these shortages combined with data from the FDA.  I also used ASHP which is a database specifically used by pharmacists to report information. I plan to use both of these data sources to derive my information and that can be shown by my sketches that I have utilized. I would not assign one data source to each sketch but more of a combination of these two sources. 


# Method and Medium 

To represent how my project will be completed, I will utilize Shorthand. I really like how you can tell a story with the data in shorthand and make it come alive. I plan to use the effects that have my facts and write up on one side of the page while having my data on the right hand side. As I scroll down and show the words, the corresponding charts and graphs will appear. If this isn't feasible, I plan to use canva as a powerpoint structure.
