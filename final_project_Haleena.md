# Outline

My topic for this project surrounds drug shortages in the United States. Before going into the specific details of the proposal, I thought the exercise we did in class was extremely helpful in making my project more concise and I shared that below to provide a background on the origins of the outline. 

**Synopsis of Topic**

For this part of the outline, I chose to come up with an engaging title that would want the audience to learn more about my topic. Though I wasn't able to solidify a title so early in the process, I settled upon these two titles. **The United States reliance on international drug manufacturers only hurts itself ** and **The United States shooting itself in the foot by leaning too heavily on international drugmakers for its medicine fix.**

The next section had
**As a reader, I want ____ so that I can_____**

As a reader, I want to explore the different perspectives and implications on manufacturer reliance so that I can make my own well informed opinion 

I can do this by_____

I can do this by maintaining open communication with my healthcare provider so that I can stay informed and be prepared for any shortages. 

How do I tell the story?

*think of the line chart from class with the emotions* 
Info, conflict, resolution, call to action for example (do not have to follow)
Y axis should be (bottom) sad, medium (alright), top (happy)

Start with - good, the U. S has the best healthcare, but we rely on a lot of other places for our drugs (small dip), usually fine (up), until its not (dip), problem (dip), implications (dip), can't do anything about the process itself (dip), but we can do something about it ****draw it out
